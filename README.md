# Cricket-Project---Masters

Hello!

Here's the code and data that I used for the project. I split it up here into three folders.

1. Pocessing the data: Shows, in order, the steps I took in processing the data from it's original form to something more useful for modelling.
2. Building the models: Each file shows the processing of building each model, used in the simulator.
3. Building the simulator: The files for the main and simple (benchmark) simulators.
4. read_csv: The folder which houses the original data that I used. The 'games_limit' file shows games which were shortened due to weather. The 'test_lineups' file includes my estimate for the number of overs each player bowls in the 2021 test games.

Enjoy.
